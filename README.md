# Resource Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm in Heterogeneous Cloud Environment

This project implements a resource allocation system for microservices using a Multi-Objective Memetic Algorithm (MOMA). It simulates and deploys optimized services to Kubernetes nodes for efficient usage of cloud resources.

## Tech Stack
- Java 20
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube)

## Features
- Microservice deployment optimization using Genetic Algorithm
- Static resource table and microservice input
- Auto-deployment on Minikube nodes
- Containerized services
